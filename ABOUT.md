*BUILD A CHECKOUT CART*

Cart is an object. That way you could escalate the solution and manage several carts.

Product is an object

 Discount is an object from the class Discounts

Add (scan) products is a method of the cart class
Apply bulk offer is a method of the cart class

Check-out is a method of the cart class

Interesting methods that could be implemented: 
- delete product
- 

Since you don't usually work on TypeScript, I over-commented the code. I know a lot of TS features are common to several languages, but I'm aware at the same time you need to check a lot of challenges from different candidates. So I'm traying to save you as much effort as possible.
